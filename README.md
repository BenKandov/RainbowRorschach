Fun little app I made with the Processing library for Java.

 Choose ink or paint and a color, draw on the left side for (randomized)replication on the right. There are two varyingly sized eraser tools, but you can press any key to automatically erase the entire drawing project.

Obviously one would need to install processing to run the pde file directly on its text editor, or configure their Java ide with the jar to run my Java file.
